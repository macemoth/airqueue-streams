# 4. Processor API for ACAS events

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For the ACAS topology, a flight can consist of hundreds to thousands of ACAS events (in our data, a flight usually only consists of dozens). The subsummation of ACAS events to a flight calls for a windowing-type operation.

## Decision

As the regular window operations work with fixed time frames and even custom extensions of the Windows class are not flexible enough, we decided to use Kafkaâ€™s Processor API for this case (AcasTopologyProcessorApi). 

## Consequences

It is challenging to identify the start and end of the flight, but we simplify the problem by assuming that the first event for a flight number received marks the beginning of the observed flight and the last event marks the end.
