# 9. Performance and scalability

Date: 2022-06-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Currently, our applications run on a single Kafka broker, and all topics have only one partition. This both does not exploit Kafkaâ€™s ability to scale horizontally, and does ignore future scaling problems. We expect the ACAS topic and the ACAS topology to be a bottleneck, as they deliver and process most events. 

## Decision

We decided to make changes to our application in order to make it more performant and scalable (see `multi` branch).

## Consequences

* We introduced a second Kafka broker, set the replication factor of all topics to 2 and allow the acas topic to have two partitions
* We implemented a custom partitioner to delegate incoming acas events to a desired partition. This opens the possibility to balance incoming events more evenly. For example, we could create stream processing instances specialised of particular flight numbers, airlines or locations.
